    <p>The ABM web application allows researchers and practitioners to automatically create corpora to test
      software
      tools and
      analyses. It crawls open-source platforms, collects projects following user-specified filters, and builds the
      projects.
      It can upload the resulting collection on Zenodo, which provides a DOI to reference it.</p>
    <p>The collections generated with ABM contain buildable, real-world, open-source projects. They contain both
      the
      executables
      and the source code of the projects.</p>
    <p class="highlight">The source code of each project should contain the licence information under which the
      project
      is released. If not, please
      refer to the corresponding GitHub webpage.</p>

    <!-- 
            <h2>Collection : Java business web applications</h2>
          <p>The first collection created for ABM can be found on the
            <a href="http://www.st.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/artifacts/webapps/">​old webpage</a>​. It was created on February
            16th, 2016, contains 139 projects, and 100 executables.

    <h3>Frequently asked Questions</h3>

    <mat-accordion multi="true">
      <mat-expansion-panel>
        <mat-expansion-panel-header>
          Why was ABM created?
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>

        <p>The ABM is a methodology designed to make benchmark creation and maintenance easier.</p>
        <p>By creating this methodology, we wish to address the following concerns:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Outdated benchmark suites: Well-established benchmark suites are often created by hand, and remain
            unchanged
            for years.
            As a result, analyses and tools are tested on outdated code, which is not representative of real-world
            software.
            By
            automatically constructing the collection, the code base can be regularly updated to provide up-to-date
            test
            projects.</li>
          <li>Analysis/tool scope: Benchmark suites are very general, and aim to cover many different types of
            software.
            On
            the other
            hand, analyses and tools are sometimes targeted at specific programs, such as Java web applications for
            example.
            Evaluating
            them on other types of software is insubstantial. When mining GitHub, the scope of the collection can
            be
            restricted
            to the target of the analysis/tool, and provide an adapted, yet still representative collection of
            up-to-date
            applications.
            The current collection targets Java web applications, and the same automated mining methodology can be
            applied to
            different
            types of target programs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For comparison and replication purposes, old versions of the collections are archived.</p>

        <mat-expansion-panel-header>
          How can I create a collection?
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>To create a collection you need to be loggedin, then search for the project type you want in your
          collection,
          add as many project as you want then click the create collection button.
        </p>

      <mat-expansion-panel>
        <mat-expansion-panel-header>
          How can I download a collection?
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>Collections that are made public by their owners are published on <a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a>.
          If you have the DOI, you can search for it directly on Zenodo.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can also browse collections on the
          <a href="#/">Collections</a> page.</p>

          How can I contribute?
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>With the ABM methodology, we strive to create more dynamic, easily updatable benchmark suites that are
          adapted
          to
          the needs
          of different target domains. The overhead of this semi-automated methodology is the manual creation of
          the
          different
          filters, which are written on top of the
          <a href="http://www.opal-project.de/Hermes.html">Hermes</a> framework. We are always happy to add new
          filters.
          To
          submit your own Hermes filters, please contact us by
          email.
        </p>

          What is the source of the projects used in ABM
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>We currently crawl open-source public repository from the following platforms for codes that match the
          projects based on user filters</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Github</li>
          <li>Maven</li>
          <li>BitBucket</li>
        </ul>
