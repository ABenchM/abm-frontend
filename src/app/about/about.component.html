    <p>The ABM web application allows researchers and practitioners to automatically create corpora to test
      software tools and analyses. It crawls open-source platforms, collects projects following user-specified filters, and builds the
      projects. It can upload the resulting collection on Zenodo, which provides a DOI to reference it.</p>
    <p>The collections generated with ABM contain buildable, real-world, open-source projects. They contain both
      the executables and the source code of the projects.</p>
    <p class="highlight">The source code of each project should contain the licence information under which the
      project is released. If not, please refer to the corresponding GitHub webpage.</p>

    <!-- 
            <h2>Collection : Java business web applications</h2>
          <p>The first collection created for ABM can be found on the
            <a href="http://www.st.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/artifacts/webapps/">​old webpage</a>​. It was created on February
            16th, 2016, contains 139 projects, and 100 executables.

    <h3>Frequently asked Questions</h3>

    <mat-accordion multi="true">
      <mat-expansion-panel>
        <mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <h6>Why was ABM created?</h6> 
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>

        <p>The ABM is a methodology designed to make collections creation and maintenance easier.</p>
        <p>By creating this methodology, we wish to address the following concerns:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Outdated benchmark suites: Well-established benchmark suites are often created by hand, and remain
            unchanged for years. As a result, analyses and tools are tested on outdated code, which is not representative of real-world
            software. By automatically constructing the collection, the code base can be regularly updated to provide up-to-date test projects.</li>
          <li>Analysis/tool scope: Benchmark suites are very general, and aim to cover many different types of software. On the other hand, analyses and tools are sometimes targeted at specific programs, such as Java web applications for
            example. Evaluating them on other types of software is insubstantial.</li>

        </ul>
       <p>ABM currently works more like a search engine targeting Java web applications, and the same automated mining methodology can be applied to different
          types of target programs. When mining GitHub, the scope of the collection can be restricted to the target of the analysis/tool, and provide an adapted, yet still representative collection of
          up-to-date applications.</p>

          <h6>How can I create a collection?</h6>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <ul class="list-style">
          <li>Make sure you are currently logged in or create an account if you don’t already have one.</li>
          <li>Navigate to the “create collection” page and enter search term based on your requirements in the search box then click the search button.</li>
          <li>Select from the search results, project repositories you would like to be a part of your collection.</li>
          <li>Click on the “create a new collection” button to create a new collection.</li> 
          <li>Provide a name and description for the new collection and click on the save button to save changes</li>  
        </ul>
      </mat-expansion-panel>
      <mat-expansion-panel>
        <mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <h6>How can I edit a collection?</h6>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure you are currently logged in or create an account if you don’t already have one.</li>
          <li>Navigate to the “my collection” page to see a list of previously created collections.</li>
          <li>Select the collection you want to edit and make changes.</li>
          <li>When you are done with all the necessary changes, you can then click on the “save changes” button to save changes</li>
        </ul>
      </mat-expansion-panel>
      <mat-expansion-panel>
          <mat-expansion-panel-header>
           <h6>How can I derive a collection from an existing collection?</h6>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <ul>
          <li>Make sure you are currently logged in. if you don’t have an account, you need to create one.</li>
          <li>Go to your “public collection” page and search for the collection you want to derive your new collection from. 
            Note that only collections marked as public are available in the public collection page and new collections can only be derived from public collections.</li>
          <li>Select your desired collection; also you could unselect one or more repository that you don’t want to be a part of the
             new collection, after which you click on the “create collection” button</li>
          <li>Enter a name and description for the new collection and click on the save button to save changes</li>
          </ul>
        </mat-expansion-panel>

        <mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <h6>How can I download a collection?</h6>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>Collections that are made public by their owners are published on <a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a>.
          If you have the DOI, you can search for it directly on Zenodo.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can also browse collections on the
          <a href="#/">Collections</a> page.</p>

          <h6>How can I contribute?</h6>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>With the ABM methodology, we strive to create more dynamic, easily updatable collections that are
          adapted to the needs of different target domains. The overhead of this semi-automated methodology is the manual creation of the different
          filters, which are written on top of the <a href="http://www.opal-project.de/Hermes.html">Hermes</a> framework. We are always happy to add new
          filters. To submit your own Hermes filters, please contact us by email.
        </p>
        <p>Alongside, our open-source git repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/ABenchM/abm">here.</a> Contributions are welcomed!</p>
